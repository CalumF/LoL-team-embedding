# LoL-team-embedding

[League of Leagends](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/) is a 5v5 team game where players can choose to play as one of 149 champions. Since each player tends to perform one of 5 roles there are 6.862560348ùê∏+10 possible team compositions. 

Can these team compositions be better understood though an embedding into a lower dimensional space? And can this new axis be used complete winning team compositions or suggest couter compositions?
